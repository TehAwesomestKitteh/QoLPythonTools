# QoLPythonUtils
A collection of Python scripts I've written that do a bunch of simple-enough things. For a lot of them, how to use them or what they do is "written on the tin" and are made to be as easy to use for non-developers as possible.

# How to Use
1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install any dependencies the script you want to use needs (see below)
3. Run the script (on Windows, double-clicking works. On console, navigate to where the scripts are stored and do `python ScriptName.py`)

# Dependencies
The following scripts need the following libraries in order to work (to install a library, visit its link below and run the `pip` command on its page):

- **ImgurLinkBruteforcer** and **ImgurLinkBruteforcerUncapped**: [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/) and [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
