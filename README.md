# QoLPythonUtils
A collection of Python scripts I've written that do a bunch of simple-enough things. For a lot of them, how to use them or what they do is "written on the tin" and are made to be as easy to use for non-developers as possible.

# Dependencies
The following scripts need the following libraries in order to work (to install a library, visit its link below and run the `pip` command on its page):

- **ImgurLinkBruteforcer** and **ImgurLinkBruteforcerUncapped**: [urllib3](https://pypi.org/project/urllib3/) and [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)
